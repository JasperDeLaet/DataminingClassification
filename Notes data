- Income > 50k -> 10% chance to accept offer -> average profit 980 euro
- Income <= 50k -> 5% chance to accept offer -> average profit -310 euro
- Cost of producing+mailing package 10 euro

- Data:

	- existing customers -> demographic info + income info

Trying to predict class

- Relevant features:
    - age, education/education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss
       hours-per-week, native-country

    - after analysis race is not a good feature as the data is imbalanced, (85 percent White, 10 percent Black, ...)
    - 90 percent of the native country data is USA -> imbalance -> consider dropping this category


    - We have a mild imbalance in the class feature (feature we want to learn) 76 percent is low income, 24 percent is high income

- Missing values:
    Missing values in workclass (1836), occupation (1843), native-country (583)
    - A solve is to delete all of these samples: Worst case: deleting 4262 (13 percent of total)

    -> we generate workclass missing values based on average

# TODO
- solve missing values workclass
- missing values native-country
- convert values to numerical values
